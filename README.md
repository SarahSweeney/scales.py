#scales.py

This is a very simple piece of software that I found very helpful during my piano grade exams.

It is a list of strings, each string a new scale. The scales have also been split according to key by comments,
for readability purposes.

At the end of the code, a random element - a random scale - is printed out onscreen.
This simulates an exam setting, where an examiner would call out a scale at random and you would have to play it.

The list of scales in this version of the code is my genuine Grade 8 Piano scales list. There are 96 scales in total.

I realise how ridiculously simple this code is, and considered not bothering to post it, but I genuinely found it helpful.
If you are doing some sort of exams where you are being asked some sort of question at random, feel free to use it.
